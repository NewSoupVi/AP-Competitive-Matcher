# AP-Competitive-Matcher

How to use:

1. Copy the A1 to AO25 range from here into values.txt (Yes, including the top row and left column): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17jgUyVK5PYnv-u29_wVT1YmmRN9hZOuF3H4JikAyJCc/edit?usp=sharing
2. Set the amount of teams in the variable around line 29
3. Probably don't change anything and just run main.py
4. If you just get "Process finished with code 0", that means no valid match was found. In this case, you are probably working with a bigger team size, and should loosen the restrictions (especially on "minimum level" and "maximum difference")
