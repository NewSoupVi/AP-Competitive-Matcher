# AP-Competitive-Matcher

How to use:

1. Get the values from here (or exact same format) and copy them into values.txt: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17jgUyVK5PYnv-u29_wVT1YmmRN9hZOuF3H4JikAyJCc/edit?usp=sharing
2. Probably don't change anything and just run main.py
3. If you just get "Process finished with code 0", that means no valid match was found. In this case, you are probably working with a bigger team size, and should loosen the restrictions (especially on "minimum level" and "maximum difference")
